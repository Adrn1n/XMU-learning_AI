## 1
Strong AI, also known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), refers to a hypothetical type of AI that possesses human-level cognitive abilities. This includes the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence to any intellectual task that a human being can. It implies consciousness, sentience, and self-awareness.

Weak AI, also known as Narrow AI, refers to AI systems designed and trained for a particular task. These systems simulate human intelligence but do not possess true understanding, consciousness, or general cognitive abilities.

### The BIV thought experiment
#### Analysis
The brain is a collection of neurons. According to neuroscience, all the feelings and perceptions in the brain are just the result of electrical impulses which activates neurons and the propagation of these activations. So theoretically, the BIV will experience no difference from a brain in a body.

#### Reflections
Our brain isn't interacting directly with the real world, but through an agent like our body or other things. So this reminds us that what we think or even feel are true might be some how illusions.

### Brain transplant experiment
#### Analysis
It is commonly agreed that, our brain is the place where all of our thoughts are. This means that the brain defines who we are and the body is just a collection of sensors and effectors for the brain to interact with the outside world.

#### Reflections
From one's own perspective, it is the brain, or more precisely, the consciousness and thoughts, that makes us who we are.

### Chinese room argument
#### Analysis
The person in the room actually knows nothing about Chinese. It is the dictionary which contains the knowledge of Chinese. The person's job is only to follow the instructions and apply the knowledge from the dictionary, thereby utilizing that knowledge for the specific task. The knowledge doesn't belong to the person and the person's job can be replaced by a machine.

#### Reflections
Knowledge or even intelligence can be extracted from the human brain into instructions and a set of rules. Other humans or machines can apply these extractions, but we can't determine whether the person or machine truly has this knowledge or intelligence. It's these extractions which contain the knowledge or intelligence, but they need a medium like a person or machine to express them.

### Current situation
The current landscape of Artificial Intelligence is largely defined by the explosive growth and widespread adoption of Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), and advanced image/video generation tools. These technologies have revolutionized various sectors, from content creation and software development to scientific research and customer service, making AI tools more accessible to the general public than ever before. We're seeing AI not just as a backend optimizer but as a creative and interactive co-pilot.

Beyond generative models, significant progress continues in areas like autonomous systems, advanced robotics, and specialized AI applications in healthcare, finance, and education. The sheer computational power and vast datasets available have pushed the boundaries of what AI can achieve in pattern recognition, prediction, and complex problem-solving.

However, current AI, while undeniably powerful, still operates within certain constraints. It lacks true common sense reasoning, often struggles with factual accuracy (hallucinations), and grapples with inherent biases present in training data. Ethical considerations, data privacy, the environmental impact of large models, and the "black box" problem are also pressing concerns that highlight the immaturity of the field in certain aspects.

### Future development and countermeasures
Looking ahead, I personally anticipate AI's evolution will unfold along several interconnected and profound dimensions:
1. Accelerated Multi-modal Fusion and Embodied AI
   AI will increasingly transcend single data types, seamlessly understanding and generating text, images, audio, and video for more natural interaction and complex task execution. Simultaneously, we'll see AI moving beyond virtual spaces to integrate with robotics and IoT devices, enabling it to perceive, decide, and act in the physical world. This will drive significant leaps in smart manufacturing, service robotics, and autonomous systems.
2. Towards Greater Generality and Autonomy
   While Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains a long-term goal, I expect AI systems to demonstrate stronger generalization capabilities and autonomous learning, adapting to new environments and solving novel problems rather than just executing pre-programmed tasks. Future AI might achieve more efficient self-supervised learning, few-shot learning, and even a nascent form of "scientific discovery".
3. Pervasive Personalization and Democratization
   AI will become deeply embedded in personal lives and work, evolving into highly personalized assistants that truly understand user intent and proactively offer services. Concurrently, through more user-friendly interfaces, lower costs, and efficient models, AI technology will become accessible to a wider demographic and a more diverse range of applications.
4. Ethics, Safety, and Explainability as Core Drivers
   As AI capabilities grow, the demands for fairness, transparency, explainability, and safety will intensify. This will shift from being an afterthought to a fundamental design principle and development imperative, leading to more responsible and trustworthy AI systems.

As AI's ability is more and more powerful, they are more competitive than ourselves. This is an undoubted trend and AI will eventually excel humans in every aspect. So I think it's not proper to push ourselves to be more competitive than current AI. The better countermeasures as human beings are to think how to cooperate with AI better with AI.
