1. Advanced information retrieval
2. Content generation
3. Data extraction and analysis
4. Multi-language support
5. Personalized recommendations

I personally think that 1, 2, 3 are the most important features of DeepSeek. DeepSeek is an LLM, so its core mechanism is token prediction, and therefore its basic usage is the text generation. Since there is an increasing amount of data on the Internet, it's hard or even impossible for us as humans to acquire comprehensive information about what we are interested in. So, an important use of DeepSeek is to intelligently seek the information we want, extract important data from all this information and finally analyze these extractions to get a concise but comprehensive understanding of the subject.
