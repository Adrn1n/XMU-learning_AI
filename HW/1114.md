	- 12-2
		1. D -> J -> V; D -> K -> X
		2. O, Q, I, T, U, Y
	- 12-3
		It's already been stated that this node and its child can be ignored, so of course they can be deleted.
2. How many coins?
3. There are $9! = 362880$ kinds of results. Impossible to draw.
4. 
	- $\alpha$: The best value found so far for the maximizing player (highest value seen on the path).
	- $\beta$: The best value found so far for the minimizing player (lowest value seen on the path)
	  
	  During the search, if the current node's value is worse than the already explored alternatives (either greater than $\alpha$ or less than $\beta$), the node and its descendants are pruned (ignored) because they won't affect the final decision.
