- Symbolism (Good Old-Fashioned AI - GOFAI)
  Focuses on representing knowledge using symbols and rules, and manipulating these symbols through logical inference. It emphasizes explicit knowledge representation and reasoning
- Connectionism (Neural Networks)
  Models intelligence based on interconnected nodes (neurons) that process in a distributed manner. It learns from data by adjusting the strength of connections between nodes, without explicit programming of rules
- Behaviorism (Embodied AI)
  Emphasizes the interaction of an agent with its environment. Intelligence emerges from simple, reactive behaviors that allow the agent to achieve goals in a complex world, often without explicit internal models or complex reasoning
